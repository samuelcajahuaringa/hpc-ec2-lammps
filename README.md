# Building a HPC Slurm Cluster using Amazon EC2 

In this repository, I document my endeavor to construct a scalable high-performance computing (HPC) cluster using ["Amazon ec2"](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instantces, specifically tailored for scientific applications. The knowledge gained from this tutorial aims to assist you to understand the  basis principles of building your own functional HPC cluster, management using ["Slurm"](https://slurm.schedmd.com/), and finally as example we run a parallel aplication the ["LAMMPS"](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0) software.
